# FootballFixtures
 
I have been sick and tired of my calender not being updated with change of fixture dates, times and cancellations.

So I am creating a project that will do that for me


## Using

Google Calender API
https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/dotnet/apis/calendar/v3

API-Football
https://www.api-football.com/


## Roadmap

1. Download the data.
2. Create event on google calender using this data.
3. Keep program running on server to update each day.
4. Add more advanced data e.g. previous meetings to description.
