# FootballFixtures
 
I have been sick and tired of my calender not being updated with change of fixture dates, times and cancellations.

So I am creating a project that will do that for me


## Using

Google Calender API
https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/dotnet/apis/calendar/v3

API-Football
https://www.api-football.com/


## Roadmap

- [x] 1. Download the data. 
- [x] 2. Create event on google calender using this data.
- [x] 3. Keep program running on server to update each day.
- [ ] 4. Add more advanced data e.g. previous meetings to description.
